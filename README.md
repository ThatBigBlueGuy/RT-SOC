# RT-SOC
Real Time Settlers of Catan

A reimagining of Settlers of Catan as fast paced

Additional Rules
1. Everyone goes at once
There are no turns, everyone draws their resource cards at once
Everyone puts down roads, towns and cities at once. The first one down wins.
2. Seasons give bonus items
Draw +1 Rock in Winter, +1 Wheat in summer, +1 Timber in Fall, and +1 Sheep in Spring

Run RT-SOC.py by installing python, then opening a cmd window in the clone directory and entering
    python RT-SOC.py 100 0.5 5 TRUE 10 
That will begin the game with 100 second turns, and 10 turn seasons turned on

The program will roll for you, tell you what turn it is, display the season, and the time left in the turn.

Good luck!
